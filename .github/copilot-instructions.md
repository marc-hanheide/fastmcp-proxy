# This code implements an MCP Server proxy to be used with Claude.ai and other MCP  Clients.

## Coding. and testing requirements:

* whenever you want to run python code, use the virtual environment configured in `.venv` and make sure you use it
* for any files you edit, run `black` (in the virtual environment) to correct the formatting, if black is available.
* be economic, avoid unnecessary computations and token usage.
* include doc strings and comments directly in the code, especially for complex logic.
* if you are unsure, ask me for guidance, rather ask before going down the wrong track
* strive for clarity and conciseness in your code and comments.
